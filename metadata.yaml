summary: |
  A charm which provides a Kubernetes installation of the PVCViewer (https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/tree/master/components/pvcviewer-controller).

  PVCViewers enable users to open a filebrowser on arbitrary persistent volume claims, letting them inspect, download, upload and manipulate data.
  
  The PVCViewer API is meant to be extensible and can easily be user for other use-cases, such as launching user-tailored apps (e.g. tensorboards or notebooks).
